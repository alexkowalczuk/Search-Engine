# Project Search Engine v4.0.0

I used custom data structure for indexing and searching
Also I implemented broad-crawl web crawler for building search Index.
The back end of it is developed on very good level. 
I spent many hours and implemented about 5000 lines of code. 
Code became almost 4x faster than v1.5.0.

Each project must pass several functionality tests and then undergo a rigorous code review checking for specific criteria, such as proper encapsulation and generalization, efficiency, and maintainability.
